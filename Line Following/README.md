An editable copy of DPRG's Line Following competition rules is available in this directory. DPRG uses this file when making changes to the competition rules. It should **_not_** be considered the "official" rules. The "official" rules are located on DPRG's website at https://www.dprg.org/contest-rules/. Rule clarifications are located at https://www.dprg.org/contest-rule-clarifications/.

The source svg files to generate courses for each level of DPRG line following competition is located in the directory named for the competition level. Also included in these directories are png files of past versions of the course. These png images are suitable for submission to https://stickersbanners.com/ without modification to generate copies of courses.

There is also a Test Course Directory which includes directories that have png files of test courses for each competition level. These smaller and cheaper courses can be obtained to test robots.
