# Test Courses for Challenge Line Following 

### File contents:
This test course directory contains a set of png images that can be used to generate vinyl practice courses. These png images are suitable to be submitted to [https://stickersbanners.com/](https://stickersbanners.com/) without modification. The courses get progressively harder. Courses were authored by Doug Paradis.

### There are 3 printable courses:
|Course Name  | Size |Approx Cost| Purpose|
| :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :------------- |
| Test 1 dp  | 3'x3'  | $13.50  | Black on White and White on Black Tiles |
| Test 2 dp  | 2'x4'  | $12.00  | Stains |
| Test 3 dp  | 4'x5'  | $30.00  | Acute angle turn, Notches, Gate |

All of the course inclued more elements than those listed in the purpose, such as line width changes. It is assumed that the competitor can successfully complete an example of the DPRG's advanced line following course.

### How to Generate a course:
