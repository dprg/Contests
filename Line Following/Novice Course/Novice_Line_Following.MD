# README Novice Course

### Note about source file contents:
The source for this course is in .svg format, and was created in Inkscape 0.92. The source file contains many primitives, each intended to be a 12" x 12" square. Some of these primitive squares are not well aligned to grid - use at your own risk - zoom way in to verify and snap to grid. Making full scale prints on elements which are not well snapped to grid yields a poor quality print.
### There are 2 printable courses:
- A reference course, good to use for copying elements already snapped to grid.
- The full Novice course, 9x5 feet.

Both courses have each element well snapped to the grid. They are known to print well. 	The blue squares provide registration, that makes it easy to accurately select one course or another

### How to Generate a course:
1. Open the source file svg
2. Using the 'arrow' select tool, draw a select box around the desired course.
3. Select file - export png
4. In the 'Export PNG' dialog (Shift+Ctrl+E)
	- Click "Selection" to ensure that Inkscape will only export the selected objects
	- Verify Image size - 150 dpi, and expected Width and Height to yield 1 foot squares
	- Choose a Filename
	- Click "Export"

PNG files support layers and alpha-channels.  This process generates a PNG with transparancy as a background. The printing service DPRG uses can accept the file and print it as-is. The printing service will usually email you a small soft-proof sample in JPG or PNG form. An alternate way to preview your course as a smaller and easier to view jpg, try this:
- Open GIMP (open source image editor) or your preferred image editor
- Import the course PNG file
- Add a white background
- Scale the image to 72 dpi and 15% of original size
- Export a JPG

Following this procedure typically gives a reasonably sized JPG file, which is easy to send around and view. However, it will have too low resolution to yield a good full sized banner print.
