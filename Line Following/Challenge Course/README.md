# README Challenge Course

### Note about source file contents:
The source for this course is in svg format, created in Inkscape 0.92. The source file contains the elements used to construct an Challenge level course. These elements are:  

1. Straight 
2. Curve 
3. Double curve
4. Offset line
5. 90 deg turn
6. Gap (sometimes called segmented) S curve
7. 6 inch gap
8. Notch
9. Acute angle
10. Bumps
11. Intersection
12. Gate
13. Line color change
14. Stains
15. Line width change

**Note:** Curves have a 6" radius.

Each element is intended to be contained in a 12" x 12" square. To accomplish this, each design element is bounded by a 12" x 12" box with a very thin red Stroke. Also included in the file are elements for use in generating indexes, and miscellaneous elements such as copyright and the DPRG logo. All these elements can be used to design a new course. 

It is a good practice to include indexes (numbers and letters) around the edge of the that allow the identification of each 12"x 12" square block. 

The source file has an example 13' x 7' course set in the document page. This course layout was used in the DPRG Roborama-A 2011 Competition. It has never been successfully completed by a robot and will remain unchanged until beaten. 

You must make sure that the element squares (i.e., 12"x12" block) are aligned and snapped to the grid. It is best to zoom way in to verify that every element square is aligned and snapped to the grid. Making full scale prints on elements which are not well snapped to grid yields a poor quality print.

### How to design a new Challenge level course:
1. Open the source svg file.
2. Use File, Document Properties (Shift+Ctrl+D) to set a custom size page. This should be one foot larger in both width and length of the desired course size. The reason for the extra foot is allow the index elements to be snapped to the grid.
3. Make sure that the "snap to grid" icon in the right vertical toolbar is highlighted. This index looks like a graph grid and is 2nd from the bottom of the toolbar.
4. Use Ctrl+c to copy an element and move the cursor to the place that you wish to place the element in the document page.
5. Use Ctrl+v to paste a copy of the element. Make sure that the element is snapped to the grid.
6. It is best to place the indexes around the side of the actual course first.
7. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the course layout is complete.



### How to prepare a course layout:
1. Using the 'arrow' select tool, draw a select box around the page. This should select everything in the page. 
2. Using Ctrl+c copy everything in the page. 
3. Place the cursor in an unused portion of the desktop and paste (Ctrl+v) a copy of the course.
4. Use Object, Ungroup to ungroup everything in the copied course.
5. Using the 'arrow' select tool, select the red stoked boxes around the edge of copied course. These should be the red stroked boxes of the index elements that are along the outside edges of the course copy. When the boxes are selected, delete them.
6. Select the copied course. Use Object, Group to group your selection into a single group. This allows you to make a course that doesn't include the empty space along the outer edge of the course, saving money when the course is sent off to be made. It also preserves your course design that is located in the page, so that it can be modified into something new.
7. Select File, Export png.   
   In the 'Export PNG' dialog (Shift+Ctrl+E)
	- Click the "Selection" tab to ensure that Inkscape will only export the selected objects.  
	- The selection should be the single group of the copied course.
	- Verify Image size - 150 dpi, and expected Width and Height to yield 1 foot squares
	- Choose a Filename
	- Click "Export"

The printing service DPRG uses can accept the png file and print it. The printing service will usually email you a small soft-proof sample in JPG form. Preview this image in the image editor of your choice.

### How to have a course printed:
1. Open [https://stickersbanners.com/](https://stickersbanners.com/) in a browser. 
2. Slide down the page to the Banner section and click on "Custom Vinyl Banners"
3. On the banner order page, insert the course dimensions, upload the file, and select the "No hem  & No grommets" finishing options.
4. Click on the "Date Due" box and accept the default.
5. Submit the order.

The banner maker (stickersbanners.com) will email conformation of the order. They will also send you a separate email with a small proof.jeg file attached to approve before starting the order. If you use the png files, in this repository directory you should have no issues.
