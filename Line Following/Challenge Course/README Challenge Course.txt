README Challenge Course

Note about source file contents
	source for this course is in .svg format, and was created in Inkscape 0.92
	the source file contains many primitives, each intended to be a 12" x 12" square.
	some of these primitive squares are not well aligned to grid - use at your own risk - zoom waaay in to verify and snap to grid. Making full scale prints on elements which are not well snapped to grid yields a poor quality print.
	there are also two 'printable' course
		a 7x9 foot subset of the Challenge course, good for practice and smaller spaces
		the full challenge course, 7x13 feet
	both courses have each element well snapped to the grid. They are known to print well.
	the blue squares provide registration, that makes it easy to accurately select one course or another

Process to Generate an output	
1. open the source file svg
2. using the 'arrow' select tool, draw a select box around the desired course.
3. select file - export png
4. in the 'Export PNG' dialog (Shift+Ctrl+E)
	click "Selection" to ensure that Inkscape will only export the selected objects
	verify Image size - 150 dpi, and expected Width and Height to yield 1 foot squares
	Choose a Filename
	=> click "Export"

Note that PNG files support layers and alpha-channels.  This process generates a PNG with transparancy as a background.
The printing service DPRG uses can accept the file and print it as-is.
The printing service will usually email you a small soft-proof sample in JPG or PNG form.
However, if you'd like to make your own proof, a smaller and easier to view jpg, try this:
	open GIMP
	import the PNG file
	add a white background
	scale the image to 72 dpi and 15% of original size
	export a JPG
	
	=> that typically gives a reasonably sized JPG file, which is easy to send around and view.
	HOWEVER, it will have too low resolution to yield a good full sized banner print.
