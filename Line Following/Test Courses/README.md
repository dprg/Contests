# Line Following Test Courses 

### Test course directories:
There are test course directories for Novice, Advanced, and Challenge level line following. Each of these directories contain a set of png images that can be used to generate vinyl practice courses. These png images are suitable for submission to [https://stickersbanners.com/](https://stickersbanners.com/) without modification. 

### Purpose of test courses:
The test courses were developed to help people test the performance of their line following robot. The layout of each course tries to balance how to achieve the purpose of the test with how much the course will cost and how much floor space the course will take.
