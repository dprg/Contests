# Line Following Test Courses 

### Test course directories:
There are test course directories for Novice, Advanced, and Challenge level line following. Each of these directories contain a set of png images that can be used to generate vinyl practice courses. These png images are suitable for submission to [https://stickersbanners.com/](https://stickersbanners.com/) without modification. 

### Purpose of test courses:
The test courses were developed to help people test the performance of their line following robot. Cost and size were the main two considerations in laying out the test courses.
