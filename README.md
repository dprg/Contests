# About DPRG

Dallas Personal Robotics Group has been actively building robots for fun since 1984.

We meet every Tuesday evening and every 2nd Saturday, and frequently participate in community events.

We typically hold contests in Spring and Fall, which are a great way to prove your prowess as a robot builder.

We usually meet at the Dallas MakerSpace, and we always welcome guests of all ages and skill levels!

We have tons of experience and love to share and trade tips and tricks.
